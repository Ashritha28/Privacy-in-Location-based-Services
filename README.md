# Privacy-in-Location-based-Services
**A survey on location and query privacy protection strategies in Location Based Services (LBS).**

With the growth of hand-held gadgets like mobile phones, tablets and
smart phones, Location-Based Services have gained immense popularity. In order
to cater to user’s demands, a Location-Based Service server would need location
information of the individual requesting the service. Providing geo-spatial informa-
tion could pose serious threats to the Location-Based Service recipients in terms of
their privacy. Privacy of the users could be of two types: Location privacy and Query
privacy.
Location privacy refers to potential abuse and misuse of an individual’s personal
information. An individual’s actions, whereabouts, movements, preferences, priorities and other such information can be inferred from the sensitive geo-spatial data
provided. Query privacy refers to the compromise on the disclosure of query data.
The anonymity of service recipients with regards to their query content is also extremely critical in preserving the privacy of the users. Thus the issue of privacy of
user location has attracted immense attention from academica as well as industry.
A survey on the state-of-techniques used for privacy protection in Location-Based
Services has been presented in the paper. Open challenges, scope for research and
future work have been elaborated towards the end.
